More on building

##Â Task

if we use nix build directly, the package will be built but not installed (symlinked) to the users enviroment

`nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A tree`{{execute}}

`ls -lha $HOME/.nix-profile/bin/tree`{{execute}}

its not been symlinked into our enviroment.

lets take a look at tree dependices dependices.

`nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A tree`{{execute}}

`nix-store -qR $(nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A tree)`{{execute}}

we can now see tree's dependices

nix-build creates a link to the resultant build called result


`ls -lha result`{{execute}}
`nix-store -qR $(readlink result)`{{execute}}
 
will get you the same dependices, as it point to the same place.


`cd /nix/var/nix/gcroots`{{execute}}

`cd profiles/per-user/nixuser`{{execute}}

`readlink profile-1-link`

`nix-store -qR $(readlink profile-1-link)`{{execute}}

this now shows all the depencices into the nix store of of your current user enviroment (profile)



lets collect garbage from the nix store

`nix-collect-garbage`{{execute}}

lots of things get delete from the nix store, including tree , which wasn't part of enviroment.



lets get back to our home install it again...

`cd $HOME`{{execute}}

when run a nix-build, a handy result directory is created, which links into the nix store.
If we don't remove this then ,the garbage collector won't clean it up

`nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A tree`{{execute}}
`rm result`{{execute}}

and collect garbage again...

`nix-collect-garbage 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep tree`{{execute}}

as expected tree (and it's dependices are garbage collected)

opposed to

`nix-env -iA nixpkgs.tree`{{execute}}

`nix-collect-garbage 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep tree`{{execute}}

as tree is now installed into of profile, the nix store knows it's in use in our profile so is not thrown in the garbage.
